Overall Questions:
- open source projects have the advantage of attracting talent outside of the normal network: how do these outside agents differ from members of the organization?
- Is position in a network associated with different contribution behavior?


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(gridExtra)

#Should save these in a file and iterate

facebook <- read.csv("Facebook_final.csv")
tensorflow <- read.csv("Tensorflow_final.csv")
r_studio <- read.csv("rstudio_final.csv")
aws <- read.csv("aws_final.csv")

facebook$org <- "facebook"
tensorflow$org<- "tensorflow"
r_studio$org <- "rstudio"
aws$org <- "aws"

full <- rbind(facebook,tensorflow,r_studio,aws)

####cleaning and conversion ####

#redundant for a couple, but this can be called later
col_nums <- c("totalRepositoriesWithContributedIssues",
              "totalCommitContributions",
              "totalIssueContributions",
              "totalRepositoriesWithContributedCommits",
              "totalPullRequestReviewContributions",
              "centrality",
              "contributions")

full[col_nums] <- sapply(full[col_nums],as.numeric)

#filter out gardener,
#add conditions and other cleaning here
#filter(centrality> median(centrality) & contributions > median(contributions)) %>% group_by(org) %>% 
  #ungroup()
  
full <- full %>% filter(contributions < 3000 & centrality) 

```

Are members of organizations more central?

```{r summarize}

standard_summary <- function(df){
  
  cent_v_df <- df %>%  filter(centrality > 0) %>% ggplot(aes(x=log(centrality),y = totalPullRequestReviewContributions, color=member)) +  geom_point() + facet_wrap(~org)
  
  dist_cent <- df %>% filter(centrality > 0) %>% ggplot(aes(x=member,y = totalPullRequestReviewContributions) ) +
                      geom_boxplot() + facet_wrap(~org)
  
  dist_cont <- df %>% filter(centrality > 0) %>%ggplot(aes(x=member,y = totalPullRequestReviewContributions)) + 
                      geom_boxplot() + facet_wrap(~org)
  
  print(cent_v_df)
  print(dist_cont)
  print(dist_cent)
}

standard_summary(full)


#(full %>% group_by(org) %>% summary())



```
obs: as we go into the top 50% of peeps in both cent and cont, trend becomes more linear


Who collaborates with the most people: why do we need to beyond just repo membership?
```{r justification}
facebook_raw <- read.csv("facebook_raw.csv")
tensorflow_raw <- read.csv("tensorflow_raw.csv")

summary(facebook_raw %>% group_by(repo) %>% summarise(members = n()))
summary(tensorflow_raw %>% group_by(repo) %>% summarise(members = n()))

#note that the api only gives the first 500 users, so some repos are undercount

```
Large variation in repo membership: simply being a member of a lot of repos doesn't say much about network contributions





What proportion of contributions are from top 10% in centrality
What is the distribution of contributions in differnet quantiles?

```{r}


#pass df that contains metric of interest and membership variables
quantile_summaries <- function(metric_and_contributors,level,org_name){
 
  #adjustable
  quantiles <- ntile(as.data.frame(metric_and_contributors[1]),level)
  df <- as.data.frame(cbind(metric_and_contributors,quantiles)) %>% mutate(quantiles = as.factor(quantiles))
  name <- names(df)
  
  quantile_dist <- df %>% ggplot() +
                          geom_boxplot(aes_string(x=(name[3]),y = name[1])) + facet_wrap(~member) + ggtitle(org_name)
  
  print(paste("--summary statistics for quantiles in ", org_name, names(metric_and_contributors[1])))
  print(quantile_dist)
  
}


list = c()
for(orga in unique(full$org)){
  df <- full %>% filter(full$org == as.character(orga)) %>% select(totalIssueContributions,member)
   quantile_summaries(df,10,orga)
}








```



What if we filter out people with only the median contribution?



Do members of orgs contribute more to repos?
```{r}





```

What type of contributions do members and nonmembers make?
```{r}

measure_summary <- function(measure,org_name){
  
  trunc <- as.data.frame(full %>% select(member, measure) %>% filter(org ==org_name))
  
  print(str(trunc))
  m <- trunc[measure]
  print(type(m))
  
  trunc %>% group_by(member) %>% summarise(avg_cont = sum(trunc[measure])/n(),
                                         med = median(trunc[measure]),
                                         iqr = IQR(trunc[measure]))
  
}

#measure_summary("totalRepositoriesWithContributedIssues","facebook")


trunc <- full %>%  filter(org =="facebook")
trunc %>% group_by(member) %>% summarise(avg_cont = sum(totalIssueContributions)/n(),
                                         med = median(totalIssueContributions),
                                         iqr = IQR(totalIssueContributions))



```

geographic differences
```{r geo}

#need some way to 

w_location <- full %>% filter(is.na(location) == F & as.character(location) != "" & as.character(location) != "[]" )

counts <- w_location %>% group_by(org,location,member) %>% summarise(n = n(), mdn.centrality = median(centrality))


for(orga in unique(counts$org)){
  print(orga)
  print(head(counts %>% filter(orga == org) %>% arrange(desc(n))),n=15)
}


```
